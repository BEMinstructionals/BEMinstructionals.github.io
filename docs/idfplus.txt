Main Goals
==========

* To be an open source, cross-platform idf editor
* To provide additional convenience features building on what the existing editor
  already does well
* Provide a platform to interact with idf files in complex ways
* To fix any annoyances with the existing editor
* to not "mess with" the idf file format, simply work with it (no custom file
  formats or incompatible changes, etc)
* To work with any version of EnergyPlus the user has installed
* More flexible views of objects (transpose, sort, filter, search)
* Full undo support
